This allows the LLM to perform tasks beyond just generating text.\\n*   **Chains of operations:**  Allows you to link together multiple LLM calls and tools to create more complex and sophisticated workflows.\\n\\n**In short, LangChain helps you build applications that use LLMs to do more than just chat.
